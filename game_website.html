				<h3>PIGGY</h3>
				<img src="game-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Game Thumbnail">
				<p><centre>Piggy is an online, survival, episodic-horror game on Roblox, created by MiniToon. <br>
					It combines the game-play and aesthetics of Granny and the style of Peppa Pig (although the game has <br>
					since strayed away from the TV show, as the game got popular and notable by many people). With different <br>
					gamemodes, players can either be a survivor or Piggy, or if selected, one can be the Traitor. <br>
					The main goal in each map for survivors is to complete different tasks and escape or reach the goal while avoiding <br>
					the Piggy before the timer runs out. Meanwhile, the Piggy has to kill all the survivors or at least prevent <br>
					them from winning.</centre></p>

				<h3>EPIC MINIGAMES</h3>
				<img src="game-thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="Game Thumbnail 1">
				<p>Epic Minigames is a round-based minigame game created by TypicalType and developed with the help <br>
					from TheSteelEagle and Azarctic. In Epic Minigames, players can play a variety of different<br>
					minigames every round. If players win a minigame, they earn 10 points (15 points in Pro Servers),<br>
					which players can spend items in the shop. After each round, players will respawn in the lobby, <br>
					where a new minigame is chosen after 10 seconds. Most minigames are usually around 30 to 90 seconds.</p>
